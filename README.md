#### **About**
After finishing a basic tutorial on Spring Boot, I wanted to attempt to create my own web application involving something of interest to me. I don't really drink that much, but I find cocktails and mixology very interesting. Therefore, I decied to create a CRUD app dealing with cocktails, planning for it to be a RESTful service.  As of now, I am focusing solely on the back-end for this project. However, once finished, I will slowly learn the languages and frameworks necessary to implement a front-end.

#### **Technologies Used**
* Java 11
* Postgresql
* Spring Boot 2.3.1
* Maven
* Intellij IDE
* Excel

#### **Process**
I initially wanted to do as many cocktails as I could, but I eventually settled to 125. I used Excel to input drinks and their properties, as well as the ingredients, garnishes, and the recipes for each drink. Next, I created a database and table using the Excel worksheets. Currently, I am working on programming the REST service and setting up the various controllers.
