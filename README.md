#### **About**
After finishing a basic tutorial on Spring Boot, I wanted to attempt to create my own web application involving something of interest to me. I don't really drink that much, but I find cocktails and mixology very interesting. Therefore, I decied to create a CRUD app dealing with cocktails. There are controllers for drinks, ingredients, garnishes, and recipes, which all connect to a databse I created using PostgreSQL As of now, I am focusing solely on the back-end for this project. 

#### **Technologies Used**
* Java 11
* Postgresql
* Spring Boot 2.3.1
* Maven
* Intellij IDE
* Excel

#### **Process**
As of Sepetember 6, I have basically finished most of the basica functionality of the web service; however, there is no front-end for me to display the information in a format other than JSON.
